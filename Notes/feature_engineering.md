# Logarithms & Power Functions

Logarithms and power functions are probbaly the most popular choice of feature transformations.

$$x_{new} = log(x)$$

$$x_{new} = x^2$$

$$x_{new} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

# Differences & Ratios

Differences and ratios are simply subtractions and fractions, respectively.

$$x_{new} = x_1 - x_2$$

$$x_{new} = \frac{x_1}{x_2}$$

# Counts

This engineered feature is a count of the number of features within a given observation that meets a particular criteria. For instance, if we were to count the features that have a negative value, the engineered feature would be 

$$x_{new} = \sum_i 1\ if\ x_i < 0\ else\ 0$$

Assuming that the observation vector had 5 values, and 2 of them were negative values, then in this hypothetical case $x_{new}$ would equal 2.

# Polynomials

Engineered features can also be generated by polynomials. For example, 

$$x_{new} = 3x^2 + 2x + 8$$

or

$$x_{new} = x^3 + 5x - 10$$

# Rational Differences & Polynomials

Combining rational equations and polynomials can also prove to be useful engineered features. For example, a _rational difference_ could take the form

$$x_{new} = \frac{x_2 - x_4}{x_1^2 - x_3^2}$$

and a _rational polynomial_ could take the form

$$x_{new} = \frac{2x_1 + 2x_3 + 4x_4^3}{3}$$
