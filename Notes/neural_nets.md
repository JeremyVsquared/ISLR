# Neural Networks

Neural networks have been proven to be a universal approximator. That is, for any given input $x$ and any given output $y$, a neural network can be trained to approximate this function. This is known as a _universality theorem_. 

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Neural networks perform particularly well at modeling rational differences and ratios, and quite poorly with rational polynomials.
