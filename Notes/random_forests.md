# Random Forests

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Random forests perform quite well modeling counts, rational differences, and ratios. It performs rather poorly on differences, logarithmic functions, polynomials, power functions, rational polynomials, and square root functions. It is also a poor choice for sparse, high dimensional data.
