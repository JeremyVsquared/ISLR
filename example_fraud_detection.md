- consider dimensionality reduction (ie, PCA): verify the features you're using are pertinent to the predictor and explains variance
- class imbalance will undoubtedly be an issue
- visualization is important to develop an intuition, or general feel, for the data set
- speak with domain experts if you don't have domain expertise to better understand factors applicable to the data set
- supervised learning problem presuming data is properly labeled
- all examples may not be properly labeled, unsupervised methods come into play here
- autoencoder neural networks are used for anomaly detection in unsupervised learning
- due to class imbalance, prediction accuracy is essentially irrelevant so performance metrics used will be __sensitivity__ and __precision__
